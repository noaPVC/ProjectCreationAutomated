# ProjectCreationAutomated
improving workflow with this python script.

## Description
--I coded this program to increase my workflow so I don't have to create the files and everything else. 
For example, you want to work on a new web-project what this program is going to do is basically create the whole projects with all standard folders, 
with all standard files containing pre made text so you don't have to do this procedure every single time--
